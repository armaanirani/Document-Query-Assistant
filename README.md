## Overview

The **Document Query Assistant** is designed to help users interact with and search through their documents using natural language queries. By leveraging modern AI techniques and vector store indexing, the app offers an intuitive interface to extract meaningful answers from uploaded files. It also includes features such as query history tracking, document management (upload, duplicate detection, and removal), and dynamic model configuration for customized responses.

## Features

- **Document Upload & Management:**  
  Upload PDFs and text files with automatic duplicate detection and metadata management.

- **PDF Text Extraction:**  
  Extract text from PDFs reliably using [PyPDF2](https://github.com/py-pdf/PyPDF2).

- **Intelligent Querying:**  
  Leverage vector-based search and OpenAI-powered language models (including GPT-4 variants and GPT-3.5 Turbo) to answer natural language questions.

- **Query History:**  
  Track previous queries with timestamps and detailed responses for future reference.

- **Model Configuration:**  
  Dynamically switch between available OpenAI models to suit different query requirements.

- **Session Persistence:**  
  Save and reload document metadata and query history for a seamless user experience.
